Speed is more important than space used, to ensure users are not left waiting for too long while the system runs.- It should be easy to add new addresses to the system as they become available, and to remove them once they are taken off the market.- The data does not need to be sorted, as employees personally work with each customer to recommend different homes, and so will be searching for entries directly.- You have only a rough estimate of how many addresses will need to be stored at a given time, and the number tends to vary by a large margin throughout the year due to seasonal buyers.Which data structure should you implement in the new system?
